Q1: Explain the difference between the == operator and the === operator:
The == operator represents the 'equal to' sign, for example 'Apple' == Orange. Where the === operator can be used to prevent type conversions //
and it represents whether a value is precisely equal to the other like "" === false

Q2: Explain what a closure is. (Note that JavaScript programs use closures very often):
When you are being able to reference a specific instance of a local binding in an enclosing scope, it is called closure.
A function that references bindings from local scopes around it is called a closure.
You can use function values in multiple ways and it frees you from being worried about the lifetime of bindings.

Q3:Explain what higher order functions are:
Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them.
Higher order functions allow us to abstract over actions and not just values.

Q4:Explain what a query selector is and give an example line of JavaScript that uses a query selector:
It shows the first element in the document that matches the given selector or group of selector. It can also return null when no matches are found.
An example: let image = document.querySelector("img");
